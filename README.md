# CS464-Touchscreen-Control-Experiment
### UFO game
In this game of skill, the player controls the grey UFO spaceship through a level to collect space rocks in the shortest amount of time possible. After the tutorial was used for training, the participants were asked to collect the space rocks in the main level. A stopwatch would start automatically once the player entered the level. Once they collected all fifteen space rocks, they were asked to stop the stopwatch and record that time on the survey provided. The participants then played the next level with a different input device and were asked to record that time as well. Participants played the game a second time with both controllers and recorded the results. This resulted in two trials for each participant.
